## Enhancement Ratios from TROPOMI and FRP Data from VIIRS S-NPP Used in "Analyzing the Impact of Evolving Combustion Conditions on the Composition of Wildfire Emissions Using Satellite Data"

### Variables in FRP_Data.xlsx are described below:
#### Please note that the data used to find the statistics for each fire was obtained from VIIRS onboard the S-NPP. Statistics were determined based on the fire location and bounding box size Only daytime data was used in our analysis.

Date: yyyy-mm-dd format

yyyymmdd: yyyymmddThhmmss format where the time (hhmmss) is the TROPOMI observation start time in UTC that can be used to map FRP data to TROPOMI data
